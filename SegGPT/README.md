   We present SegGPT, a generalist model for segmenting everything in context. With only one single model, SegGPT can perform arbitrary segmentation tasks in images or videos via in-context inference, such as object instance, stuff, part, contour, and text. 
   SegGPT is evaluated on a broad range of tasks, including few-shot semantic segmentation, video object segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. 
   Our results show strong capabilities in segmenting in-domain and out-of-domain targets, either qualitatively or quantitatively.
